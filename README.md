# ðŸŒ¾ Smart Sprinkler System â€“ Streamlit App

This Streamlit web app uses a trained machine learning model to predict the **on/off status of irrigation sprinklers** (for different land parcels) based on real-time **sensor data**.

It is designed as part of a **Smart Irrigation System** that helps optimize water usage on farms using predictive intelligence.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **User Interface** to input sensor values (scaled between 0 and 1)
- **Predictive Output** showing which sprinklers (parcel_0 to parcel_2) should be turned ON or OFF
- **Easy deployment** via Streamlit
- **Supports up to 20 input sensors**
